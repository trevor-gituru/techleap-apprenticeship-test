## **SECTION 1: Logic & Problem Solving (10 marks)**

**Question 1:**  
 Write a function that returns the second-largest number in a given list of integers.  
 *(Provide your code and a short explanation of your approach.)*

**Question 2:**  
 Explain how you would optimize a page that loads too slowly. Mention at least **three causes** and how you’d fix each.

## **SECTION 2: Web/Software Development (15 marks)**

**Question 3 (Front-end):**  
 You are creating a simple profile page that fetches user data from an API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1`).  
 Explain or show code for:

* Fetching and displaying the user’s name and email.

* Handling the loading and error states.

*(You may use plain JS, React, or any stack you’re comfortable with.)*

**Question 4 (Back-end / Logic):**  
 A small store wants to calculate total sales from this dataset:

`[`  
  `{"item": "Pen", "price": 20, "quantity": 3},`  
  `{"item": "Book", "price": 200, "quantity": 2},`  
  `{"item": "Bag", "price": 800, "quantity": 1}`  
`]`

Write a short function to calculate the **total revenue**.

## **SECTION 3: Debugging & Reasoning (10 marks)**

**Question 5:**  
 You’ve been given this code snippet:

`numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
`for i in range(len(numbers)):`  
    `if i % 2 == 0:`  
        `numbers.remove(i)`  
`print(numbers)`

1. What’s wrong with the code?

2. What will it output?

3. How would you fix it to remove even numbers correctly?

## **SECTION 4: Version Control & Collaboration (5 marks)**

**Question 6:**  
 Explain how you would use Git to collaborate on a team project with other developers.  
 Mention at least:

* One common Git command you use often.

* One problem you’ve faced while using Git and how you solved it.
